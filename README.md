# Shadifyer

**Generate colors of light and shadow**  
Shadifyer creates light and shadow color variants from a single base color using the HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) model. It shifts hue toward nearby anchor tones (like yellow for light or blue for shadow), increases brightness for light shades, and decreases it for shadow shades. Saturation is adjusted to make lights softer and shadows deeper. The result is a set of cohesive CSS variables ready for use in theming.
